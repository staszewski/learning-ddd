1.  What is Domain Driven Development?   
- DDD is the software development approach. It’s goal is to build and maintain a model of the problem that we are trying to solve.
2.  Elements of efficient model
-   Bind the model with its implementation
-   Perfecting the language that was established while defining a model    
-   Developing a model enriched with knowledge    
-   Maintaining a model - things that haven’t worked out need to be removed from the model.    
-   Discussion and experimentation - a team with the correct mindset develops a high quality model. The environment has to be open for discussion and experimentation.
